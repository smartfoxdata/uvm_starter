## uvm_starter

The uvm_starter package is a set of source files that implements a very simple UVM test environment. Coincidentally, uvm_starter can be run completely using only the free simulator Modelsim ASE (Altera Starter Edition). It is meant to be a starting point for making more elaborate UVM testbenches or for learning the basics UVM.
